This circuit has 8 possible modes of operation . I have used a frequency halver here , so for each of the 4 modes , we have 2 submodes of slow and fast blinking . The 4 unique modes can make the lights blink in different patterns ( We will be attaching 4 lines of LED's of different colours (say red , blue , yellow , green ) at the points A, B, C, D and these lines as a whole will take a particular state in the pattern ) . Furthermore , the patterns can be changed by pressing a single button multiple times (just like the commercial christmas/diwali lights we get in the market )

By using band elimination filters parallel to every led and using a variable frequency AC source , we can make beautiful patterns of LED too . Whenever a particular frequency of signal is passed throught the chain, only the LED with the Band Elimination Filter corresponding to the particular frequency will light up , thus by varying the frequencies rapidly or even inputting a signal which is a mixture of different frequencies , we can get different patterns . Furthermore , this can be turned into a cheap commercial device to quickly get the range of the frequency in which the input signal lies , thus being a great invention .
